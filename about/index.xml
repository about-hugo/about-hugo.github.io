      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve created this project to collect all the various hugo examples I&amp;rsquo;ve created over the last several years, to document and establish their usage as a learning tool in my various software development and web technology classes.&#xA;Currently - as of May 2024 - it&amp;rsquo;s work in progress. Contributions are Welcome!&#xA;How to Contribute As a Hugo project, creation and collaboration on this site is very similar to an open source software project.</description>
