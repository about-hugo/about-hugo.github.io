This section contains tryouts of some of [the many available hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/).

The repos can be used as starting points for your own hugo site. They all should deploy to the repo's gh page immediately after setting the correct
baseURL for your repo in either .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml (see for example
the one in [whisper-theme-tryout](https://github.com/about-hugo/whisper-theme-tryout/blob/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml)) directly or the
environment config file used there (if hugo is called with hugo -e production).
