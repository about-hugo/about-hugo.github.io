This is a theme based on HBStack.
HBStack is is a modular framework for building Hugo pages,
see https://hbstack.dev/
Both the framework and theme are massive and seem well-designed and
powerful; before starting a project with it some time would be 
necessary to explore and evaluate this framework.
