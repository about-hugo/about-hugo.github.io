A sleek, beautiful documentation theme based on bootstrap, which is also
used for [this page](/sites/about-hugo-github-io/).

The Whisper Theme has some limitations, e.g.
with the menu in the upper right the number of section is limited.
It does not support a folder structure within the sections, as all pages
found in the section are directly listed.

I've created a fork for this page as I wanted to include mermaid.
As it is based on Bootstrap, it should be easy to extend as needed, but
for larger documentation projects something like geekdoc is probably a better start.
