I've created this project to collect all the various
hugo examples I've created over the last several years,
to document and establish their usage as a learning
tool in my various software development and web technology classes.

Currently - as of May 2024 - it's work in progress. Contributions are Welcome!

## How to Contribute

As a Hugo project, creation and collaboration on this
site is very similar to an open source software project.

See the github [repo's readme](https://github.com/about-hugo/about-hugo.github.io) for more information.
