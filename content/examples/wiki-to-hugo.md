Wiki to Hugo is a repo to try out creating content using a github wiki.

(not a hugo page!)

Github Wikis are very simple wikis which can be attached to a github
repo. As they allow to use github flavoured markdown as their
content format, they can be a starting point to collect content in a team
with a minimum setup.

Github Wikis are git repositories themselves, which allows for the content to be 
edited not only online, but also with your local editing tools and using git 
as a tool for version control and to solve merge conflicts.

With an educational license, they can be created for private repos making them also
private, which makes them feasible for collection content that may not (yet) be published.
